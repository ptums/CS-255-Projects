# CS-255 Projects


## Overview
This repository contains the business requirmenets document from Project 1# and the system design document from Project 2#. These documents demonstrate your ability to collect requirements from the customer and design a system that meets those needs.

## Reflection

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

### What did you do particularly well?


### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
