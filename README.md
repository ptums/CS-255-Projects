# CS-255 Projects

## Overview
This repository contains the business requirmenets document from Project 1# and the system design document from Project 2#. These documents demonstrate my ability to collect requirements from the customer and design a system that meets those needs.

## Reflection

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client is DriverPass, and they want to create an app that offers training for students preparing for their driving tests at the local DMV. The app will offer online classes, practice tests, and on-road training for those who want it.


### What did you do particularly well?

What I believe I did particularly well was organizing the various UML diagrams. I quite enjoyed the process of taking the written business document and turning it into diagrams. I found that going through this process helped me better understand how to design the DriverPass system and gain a more detailed understanding of the client's requirements.


### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I believe I should keep working on the UML diagrams. Specifically, I can enhance the UML Class Diagram by adding methods for each class. Additionally, I'd like to revisit the UML Use Case Diagram for a second pass. I think I can improve its appearance with better graphics and provide more detailed information about each case, rather than simply  saying CRUD this and CRUD that... which might sound unclear.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I found that when I was filling out the functional part of the business document, I needed to have a good understanding of the user's needs. In the section for functional requirements, where I had to complete the sentence "The system shall...", I interpreted the user's needs and then transformed them into practical tasks. I believe that reviewing business requirements and converting them into tasks is an excellent way to learn how to communicate with both business and technical professionals. Turning business needs into tasks is crucial for designing a system because it establishes a clear line of communication between business and technical teams.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I believe that for a project like DriverPass, I should start by finalizing the UML Class Diagram and then proceed to implement each object in the diagram using Java. In the future, I plan to enhance the activity diagrams by adding more features. After the product is launched, and the business gathers feedback from users, they will likely request new features and updates. Based on the feedback, I will restructure the activity diagrams with the new information. I anticipate needing to reorganize the activity diagrams collectively because as they grow, they may become more challenging to understand. My goal is to make them easily accessible for different members of the business and technical team.
